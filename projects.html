                <h1><b>RL Playground</b></h1>
                <p>Implementing algorithms is the best practice ever, so I thought why not set up a whole playground for it?
                The project features various environments, no matter if Gymnasium or custom ones and has support for every imaginable
                DeepRL agent. It is built in a modular way: To try out different configurations simply update the config file. Want to
                develop your own environment? No problem, implement it according to the interface and start training!
                Want to monitor training? No worries, the built in HTTPLogger and real-time web dashboard has you covered.</p>
                
                <p>This project only recently started, so there is much more to come!</p>

                <h1><b>FastLearner</b></h1>
                <p>Picture this: It is 1am, you have an essay due the next day and need some citations
                that are reliable and actually talk about the content of your essay. LLMs might help, but they are too prone to hallucinate,
                after all, they're likely no experts in the field you are writing about. If only there was a way to give an LLM all of the necessary literature and let it cite from there.
                </p>
                <p><i>Enter FastLearner.</i></p>
                <p>Built on top of the Mistral API (or using local ollama instances), this project encapsulates exactly this:
                    A RAG approach to late-night deadline-keeping. You upload the relevant documents on the web interface, which will subsequently be embedded and stored in a vector
                    store ontology. In the chat, you can then ask questions about the literature and FastLearner will respond with the number of the page it found the information on.
                    Fast, lightweight attribution, exactly what is needed in moments like these.
